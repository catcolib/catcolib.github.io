# Welcome to Code Club!

Join us at the Catoosa County Library every Wednesday from June 5 through August 28, between 3:00 and 5:00. <br>

You can work on any project you want. We have a ton of suggestions to help you get started creating something awesome. There are some ideas at the bottom... <br>

If you don't know what you want to do, our club leader will work with you to find something fun to start with. Maybe you want to build a game, or a website, or a circuit board, or a robot -- the opportunities are endless! <br>

**No supplies, experience, or skill required!** <br>

You will need to bring one or more of the following: <br>
- A laptop or Chromebook
- An active, unexpired library card (to check out a Chromebook or use a library computer)
- A driver's license or other collateral for us to hold so you can borrow a laptop
- (18 or older) [Acceptable ID](https://pines.georgialibraries.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=circ:accounts#acceptable_forms_of_id) to sign up for a library card
- (Under 18) A parent or legal guardian with [acceptable ID](https://pines.georgialibraries.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=circ:accounts#acceptable_forms_of_id) to sign up for a library card

**Important:** Library policy requires anyone under the age of 13 to be accompanied by an adult at all times while in the library. <br>

## A note on accounts...

**You are not required to create any online accounts to participate.** <br>

However, it may be helpful to create the following accounts to save your work, share your work, and contribute to other people's projects. You can create these in advance or at Code Club.

- GitHub
- Google
- Microsoft
- Scratch
